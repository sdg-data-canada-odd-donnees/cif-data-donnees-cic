# Indicator definition and additional information

national_indicator_description: This indicator measures the rate of involuntary part-time
  work. The rate of involuntary part-time work can be derived in different ways. The
  one used for this indicator is based on all involuntary part-time workers, whether
  they looked for full-time work or not. The rate is then presented as the number
  of involuntary part-timers as a share of the part-time employed.

  Excluded from the survey’s coverage are: persons living on reserves and other Aboriginal settlements in the provinces; the institutionalized population, and households in extremely remote areas with very low population density.
  <br><br>
  The Labour Force Survey (LFS) started collecting gender of person in 2022. Prior to 2022, LFS only collected information on sex of person (male or female), as declared by the respondent or recorded by the interviewer. The sex variable prior to 2022 and the two-category gender variable since 2022 are combined in this table. Although sex and gender refer to two different concepts, the introduction of gender is not expected to have a significant impact on data analysis and historical comparability, given the small size of the transgender and non-binary populations.
  <br><br>
  Given that the non-binary population is small, data aggregation to a two-category gender variable is necessary to protect the confidentiality of responses provided. Individuals in the category “non-binary persons” are distributed into the other two gender categories and are denoted by the “+” symbol. The category “Men+” includes men, as well as some non-binary persons, while the category “Women+” includes women, as well as some non-binary persons.
