  living with obesity. The indicator uses the body mass index (BMI) which
  is calculated by dividing the respondent's body weight (in kilograms) by their height
  (in metres) squared.

  According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and Health Canada guidelines, the index for body weight classification for the population aged 18 and older is: less than 18.50 (underweight); 18.50 to 24.99 (normal weight); 25.00 to 29.99 (overweight); 30.00 to 34.99 (obese, class I); 35.00 to 39.99 (obese, class II); 40.00 or greater (obese, class III). The population aged 5 to 17 is classified as "overweight" or "obese" according to age and sex specific cut-off points defined by the World Health Organization.

  Data from the Canadian Health Measures Survey are collected over a two-year period from a sample of approximately 5,700 respondents. The result for reference year 2011, which encompasses responses collected over the period of 2009-2011, is taken as the 2010 baseline for obesity.
