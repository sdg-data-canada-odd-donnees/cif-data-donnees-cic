data_keywords: alcohol, consumption

national_indicator_available: Alcohol per capita consumption (aged 15 years and older)
  within a calendar year in litres of pure alcohol
target_name: By March 31, 2025, pure alcohol sales per person (aged 15 years and older)
  in a year are 8.0 litres or less
national_indicator_description: Research shows that per capita consumption is correlated
  with mortality, burden of disease and other alcohol harms. Per capita sales is a
  suitable proxy indicator for per capita consumption. A change in volume of sales
  (increase or decrease) would be reflective of a similar change in volume of consumption.
national_geographical_coverage: Canada, provinces and territories
computation_calculations: Volume of pure alcohol sales in Canada / Canadian population
  aged 15 years and older
comments_limitations: The indicator covers recorded sales of alcohol by volume per
  capita by liquor authorities and their agencies, including wineries, breweries,
  and other regulated outlets. The indicator does not capture unrecorded per capita
  consumption, such as homebrewing, illegally produced or sold alcohol, or alcohol
  transported into a different jurisdiction.
