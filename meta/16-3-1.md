# Indicator definition and additional information

national_indicator_description: This indicator measures the rate of cyber-crimes per
  100,000 population.

computation_calculations: A criminal incident may be comprised of multiple violations
  of the law. For the analysis of cyber-related violations, one distinct violation
  within the incident was identified as the 'cybercrime violation'. The cybercrime
  violation represents the specific criminal violation within an incident in which
  a computer or the internet was the target of the crime, or the instrument used to
  commit the crime. For the majority of incidents, the cybercrime violation and the
  most serious violation were the same.

comments_limitations: Includes data from municipal and provincial police services
  as well as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) covering 99.6% of the Canadian
  population. Prior to 2020, the number of cybercrimes is an undercount as some police
  services were unable to report the cybercrime indicator for all years. Calgary Police
  Service cybercrime data for 2017-2022 are suspected cybercrimes only and should
  be interpreted with caution. Saint John Police Force cybercrime data for 2021 and
  2022 represent incidents that are suspected cybercrimes only and should be interpreted
  with caution. The 2022 counts for some police services in the province of Quebec
  may be an undercount due to a system upgrade issue.
