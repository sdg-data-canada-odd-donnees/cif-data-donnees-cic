# Ind def and add info

national_indicator_description: This indicator measures the gender wage ratio. The
  gender wage ratio can be interpreted as the proportion of a dollar that women earn
  for every dollar earned by men.

computation_calculations: The gender wage ratio is the wage for women divided by the
  wage for men. Alternatively, the gender wage ratio can be subtracted from one and
  then multiplied by 100, such that it represents, when positive, how much less women
  earn than men in percentage terms (or, in the case of a negative percentage, how
  much more women earn than men).

comments_limitations: 'Excluded from the coverage are: persons living on reserves
  and other Aboriginal settlements in the provinces; full-time members of the Canadian
  Armed Forces, the institutionalized population, and households in extremely remote
  areas with very low population density. These groups together represent an exclusion
  of less than 2% of the Canadian population aged 15 and over.'
