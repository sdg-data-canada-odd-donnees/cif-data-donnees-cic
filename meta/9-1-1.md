# Indicator definition and additional information

national_indicator_description: The indicator measures the proportion of patents in
  environment-related technology out of the total number of patents.

computation_calculations: A five-year moving average was used to smooth for election
  and policy impacts that could affect the data during a specific year.

comments_limitations: 'Patents are subject to certain drawbacks: the value distribution
  of patents is skewed as many patents have no industrial application (and hence are
  of little value to society) whereas a few are of substantial value; many inventions
  are not patented because they are not patentable or inventors may protect the inventions
  using other methods, such as secrecy, lead time, etc.; the propensity to patent
  differs across countries and industries; differences in patent regulations make
  it difficult to compare counts across countries; and changes in patent law over
  the years make it difficult to analyse trends over time. ([OECD Stat](https://stats.oecd.org/))'
