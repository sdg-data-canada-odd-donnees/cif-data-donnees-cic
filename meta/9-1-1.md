# Indicator definition and additional information

national_indicator_description: The indicator measures the proportion of enterprises
  that introduced innovations with environmental benefits. An innovation is a new
  or improved product or process (or combination thereof) that differs significantly
  from the unit's previous products or processes and that has been made available
  to potential users (product) or brought into use by the unit (process).

computation_calculations: 'The national stratification corresponds to enterprises
  with at least $250,000 in revenues within the target industrial groupings and the
  enterprise size (based on the number of employees): <br> - Small enterprises (20
  to 99) <br> - Medium-sized enterprises (100 to 249) <br> - Large enterprises (250
  or more) <br><br>The regional stratification corresponds to enterprises with at
  least $250,000 in revenues within the target industrial groupings for the following
  regions: The Atlantic region, Quebec, Ontario, Alberta and the Rest of Canada. Provinces/regions
  not listed were not individually sampled.'

comments_limitations: 'Regional distribution by size of enterprise is not available.
  <br><br> "Innovations with any environmental benefits" includes: innovations with
  environmental benefits from production through efficient use of resources, innovations
  with environmental benefits related to increased environmental protection activities,
  or innovations with environmental benefits related to the end user or consumer.
  <br><br> "Innovations with environmental benefits from production through efficient
  use of resources" includes: improved resource efficiency through reduced material
  use per unit of output, improved resource efficiency through reduced energy use
  per unit of output, improved resource efficiency by replacing material with less
  greenhouse-gas-intensive alternatives, reduced consumption of resources through
  recycling (water, waste or material), or renewable fuels (ethanol, biodiesel, biogas,
  biochar, hydrogen). <br><br> "Innovations with environmental benefits related to
  increased environmental protection activities" includes: reduced air, water, soil
  or noise pollution, or reduced greenhouse gas emissions. <br><br> "Innovations with
  environmental benefits related to the end user or consumer" includes: reduced energy
  use or increased energy efficiency for the end user or consumer, reduced material
  use or increased recycling for the end user or consumer, reduced air, water, soil
  or noise pollution for the end user or consumer, or reduced greenhouse gas emissions
  for the end user or consumer.'
