# Indicator definition and additional information

national_indicator_description: This indicator measures the employment rate. The employment
  rate is the number of persons employed expressed as a percentage of the population
  15 years of age and over.

computation_calculations: The employment rate for a particular group (age, sex, marital
  status, etc.) is the number of employed persons in that group expressed as a percentage
  of the labour force for that group. Estimates are percentages, rounded to the nearest
  tenth.

  Excluded from the coverage are: persons living on reserves and other Aboriginal settlements in the provinces; full-time members of the Canadian Armed Forces, the institutionalized population, and households in extremely remote areas with very low population density. Estimates for Canada (total) are a sum of the provincial totals and exclude the territories. Estimates for proportions by sex and age groups exclude the territories.

  The Indigenous population estimates presented in this table are the result of a projection based on 2016 population counts; they are not population estimates. When possible, the projection was calibrated to reflect recent trends observed for the total Canadian population, but it relies primarily on assumptions about the components of growth and, as such, a certain level of uncertainty is associated with it. As an example of the level of uncertainty, the projected Indigenous population in 2015 varies by 96,000 people between the five scenarios presented in the Statistics Canada report Projections of the Aboriginal Population and Households in Canada, 2011 to 2036.

  According to the Employment Equity Act, visible minorities are "persons, other than Aboriginal peoples, who are non-Caucasian in race or non-white in colour." Visible minority n.i.e includes persons with a write-in response such as Guyanese, West Indian, Tibetan, Polynesian, Pacific Islander. The abbreviation "n.i.e." means "not included elsewhere". Multiple visible minorities includes persons who gave more than one visible minority group by checking two or more mark-in responses, for example, Black and South Asian.

  Landed immigrants refer to people who are, or have been, landed immigrants in Canada. A landed immigrant is a person who has been granted the right to live in Canada permanently by immigration authorities. Canadian citizens by birth and non-permanent residents (persons from another country who live in Canada and have a work or study permit, or are claiming refugee status, as well as family members living here with them) are not landed immigrants.

  The Labour Force Survey (LFS) started collecting gender of person in 2022. Prior to 2022, LFS only collected information on sex of person (male or female), as declared by the respondent or recorded by the interviewer. The sex variable prior to 2022 and the two-category gender variable since 2022 are combined in this table. Although sex and gender refer to two different concepts, the introduction of gender is not expected to have a significant impact on data analysis and historical comparability, given the small size of the transgender and non-binary populations.

  Given that the non-binary population is small, data aggregation to a two-category gender variable is necessary to protect the confidentiality of responses provided. Individuals in the category “non-binary persons” are distributed into the other two gender categories and are denoted by the “+” symbol. The category “Men+” includes men, as well as some non-binary persons, while the category “Women+” includes women, as well as some non-binary persons.

#The Canadian Survey on Disability identifies persons with disabilities using the Disability Screening Questions (DSQ),  which are based on the social model of disability. The DSQ first measure the degree to which difficulties are experienced across 10 domains of functioning, then ask how often daily activities are limited by these difficulties. Only persons who report a limitation in their day-to-day activities are identified as having a disability. <br><br> Given that the non-binary population is small, data aggregation to a two-category gender variable is necessary most of the time to protect the confidentiality of responses. In these cases, individuals in the category "non-binary persons" are distributed into the other two gender categories and are denoted by the "+" symbol. <br><br>
