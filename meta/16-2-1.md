# Indicator definition and additional information

national_indicator_description: The Crime Severity Index (CSI) measures changes in
  the level of severity of police-reported crime in Canada from year to year. The
  crime severity index includes all Criminal Code violations including traffic, as
  well as drug violations and all Federal Statutes.

computation_calculations: In the index, all crimes are assigned a weight based on
  their seriousness. The level of seriousness is based on actual sentences handed
  down by the courts in all provinces and territories. More serious crimes are assigned
  higher weights, less serious offences lower weights. As a result, more serious offences
  have a greater impact on changes in the index. The PRCSI is standardized to 100
  in base year 2006.

comments_limitations: The Crime Severity Index is not available for police services
  or detachments with populations less than 1,000. Data for police services or detachments
  with populations less than 5,000 should be used with caution.
