# Indicator definitiona and additional information

national_indicator_description: "This indicator measures the proportion of Canada's terrestrial (land and freshwater) area that is conserved. <em>Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC)</em>"

computation_calculations: "The area conserved is estimated by means of a geographical analysis based on reported boundaries, accounting for overlaps. <em>(ECCC)</em>"

comments_limitations: "Comparisons with previous reports should be made with caution, as data quality and completeness continue to improve. Privately protected land and other effective area-based conservation measures contribute to achievement of Canada's targets, but many are not yet captured within the database. <em>(ECCC)</em>"
