# Indicator definitiona and additional information

national_indicator_description: This indicator measures the proportion of Canada's
  terrestrial (land and freshwater) area that is conserved. Conserved areas are lands
  and waters where human use is limited. They include protected areas as well as other
  effective area-based conservation measures. <em>Environment and Climate Change Canada
  (ECCC)</em>

computation_calculations: The area conserved is estimated by means of a geographical
  analysis based on reported boundaries, accounting for overlaps. <em>(ECCC)</em>

comments_limitations: <p>Trends are estimated based on the date a site was established,
  rather than the date when it was recognized as a Protected Area or other effective
  area-based conservation measure (OECM). As such, the totals for a previous year
  may change as data are updated. <br><br>Comparisons with previous reports should
  be made with caution, as data quality and completeness continue to improve. Privately
  protected land and other effective area-based conservation measures contribute to
  achievement of Canada's targets, but many are not yet captured within the database.
