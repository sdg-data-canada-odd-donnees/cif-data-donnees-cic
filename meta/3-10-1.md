  Many Canadian Chronic Disease Surveillance System (CCDSS) measures, such as chronic disease incidence, were influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Changes in such measures may be driven by multiple factors, including (but not limited to) differences in healthcare seeking behaviour, the availability and use of healthcare services, as well as true changes in health status. As such, CCDSS measures should be used cautiously when making inferences about population health during the COVID-19 pandemic.
