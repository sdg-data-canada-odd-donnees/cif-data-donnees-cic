comments_limitations: "<p>Due to content changes, this indicator is now derived from\
  \ data collected from an optional content module (based on provincial and territorial\
  \ selection), therefore not all provinces have data for 2018. <br><br>The indicator\
  \ covers the population 12 years of age and over living in the ten provinces. Excluded\
  \ from the survey's coverage are: persons living on reserves and other Aboriginal\
  \ settlements in the provinces; full-time members of the Canadian Forces; the institutionalized\
  \ population, children aged 12-17 that are living in foster care, and persons living\
  \ in the Quebec health regions of Région du Nunavik and Région des Terres-Cries-de-la-Baie-James.\
  \ Altogether, these exclusions represent less than 3% of the Canadian population\
  \ aged 12 and over.</p>"
