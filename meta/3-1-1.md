comments_limitations: "<p>Due to content changes, this indicator is now derived from data collected from an optional content module (based on provincial selection), therefore not all provinces have data for 2018. <br><br>The indicator covers the population 12 years of age and over living in the ten provinces. Excluded from the survey's coverage are: persons living on reserves and other Aboriginal settlements in the provinces; full-time members of the Canadian Forces; the institutionalized population, children aged 12-17 that are living in foster care, and persons living in the Quebec health regions of Région du Nunavik and Région des Terres-Cries-de-la-Baie-James. Altogether, these exclusions represent less than 3% of the Canadian population aged 12 and over.</p>"
