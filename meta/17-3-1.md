# Indicator definition and additional information

national_indicator_description: This indicator measures the estimated exports of environmental
  and clean technology products (in millions of dollars) to developing countries.
  Exports of environmental products include environmental goods, such as clean electricity,
  biofuels and primary goods, and waste and scrap goods, as well as waste management
  and remediation services. Exports of clean technology products include clean technology
  goods as well as clean technology services, including scientific and research and
  development services, support services, and construction services.

computation_calculations: Developing countries are determined for each year based
  on their Human Development Index (HDI) reported by the United Nations Development
  Programme. Those with an HDI below 0.8 are considered as developing countries. The
  data for this indicator is calculated as the sum of all exports of environmental
  and clean technology products destined to developing countries with a HDI below
  0.8.

comments_limitations: Data for the last two reference years are preliminary. The United
  Nations does not produce HDI data for some countries listed in Statistics Canada's
  exports database. These countries are therefore not included in the final data for
  exports of environmental and clean technology products to developing countries.
