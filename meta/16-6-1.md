# Indicator definition and additional information

national_indicator_description: The adult incarceration rate represents the average
  number of adults in custody per day for every 100,000 individuals in the adult population
  (18 years and older). It includes adults in sentenced custody, remand and other
  temporary detention.

computation_calculations: Incarceration rates are based on total actual-in counts,
  as well as population estimates provided by Demography Division of Statistics Canada.

comments_limitations: <p> Although the Corrections Key Indicator Report attempts to
  standardize the way in which data are reported, limitations due to differences among
  jurisdictional operations may restrict uniform application of the definitions in
  some situations. For this reason, inter-jurisdictional comparisons of the data should
  be made with caution. <br> Due to rounding, figures may not add to totals. </p>
