national_indicator_available: Rate of apparent opioid toxicity deaths per 100,000
  population
target_name: By March 31, 2028, reduce the rate of apparent opioid toxicity deaths
  to 10 per 100,000 population

national_indicator_description: 'This indicator measures the rate of apparent opioid-related
  deaths. <br><br> Apparent opioid-related death: A death caused by intoxication/toxicity
  (poisoning) as a result of drug use, where one or more of the drugs is an opioid.'
national_geographical_coverage: Canada, provinces and territories

computation_calculations: 'Rate of deaths is calculated by: Count from provinces/territories
  data / mid-year population estimate x 100,000.  <br><br> Data comes from analysis
  of provincial/territorial coroner data (at different stages of readiness). Data
  is provided from Provincial/Territorial coroner data through PHAC. Indicator data
  will be disaggregated by sex, provinces/territories and age group, where possible.
  <br><br> The data includes: open (preliminary) and closed (certified) cases; non-natural
  manners of death (both intentional and unintentional); and individuals with or without
  prescriptions. The data does not include deaths due to chronic substance use, medical
  assistance in dying, and trauma where a poisonous substance contributed to the circumstances
  of the injury.'

comments_limitations: The national overall count includes deaths from British Columbia
  (2019 onwards) related to all unregulated drugs and Quebec (2022 onwards) related
  to drug or opioid-related intoxication. Provinces and territories are included in
  calculations of national crude rates if they have submitted data for at least one
  quarter of a given year.
