comments_limitations: "<p>Due to data availability, the indicator currently only measures the proportion of Canadians aged 12 years old and over who are cigarette smokers as opposed to ones aged 15 years old and over. The indicator does not take into account the number of cigarettes smoked. <br><br>The indicator covers the population 12 years of age and over living in the ten provinces. Excluded from the survey's coverage are: persons living on reserves and other Aboriginal settlements; the institutionalized population, and children aged 12-17 that are living in foster care.</p>"
