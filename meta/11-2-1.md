# Indicator definition and additional information

national_indicator_description: "This indicator measures the proportion of households
  in core housing need. Core housing need refers to whether a private household's
  housing falls below at least one of the indicator thresholds for housing adequacy,
  affordability or suitability, and would have to spend 30% or more of its total before-tax
  income to pay the median rent of alternative local housing that is acceptable (attains
  all three housing indicator thresholds). Housing indicator thresholds are defined
  as follows: <br><br> - Adequate housing is reported by their residents as not requiring
  any major repairs. <br><br> - Affordable housing has shelter costs equal to less
  than 30% of total before-tax household income. <br><br> - Suitable housing has enough
  bedrooms for the size and composition of resident households according to the National
  Occupancy Standard (NOS), conceived by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation
  and provincial and territorial representatives."

computation_calculations: Not applicable

comments_limitations: Data at the national level do not include the territories. All
  geographic regions are based on the 2021 Census boundaries.<br><br> Only private,
  non-farm, non-reserve and owner- or renter-households with incomes greater than
  zero and shelter-cost-to-income ratios less than 100% are assessed for ‘core housing
  need.’ Non-family households with at least one maintainer aged 15 to 29 attending
  school are considered not to be in ‘core housing need’ regardless of their housing
  circumstances. Attending school is considered a transitional phase, and low incomes
  earned by student households are viewed as being a temporary condition.
