# Indicator definition and additional information

national_indicator_description: This indicator measures the proportion of household
  that lives in core housing need.

computation_calculations: Number of households in core housing need divided by all
  households for each category.

comments_limitations: ' Only private, non-farm, non-reserve and owner- or renter-households
  with incomes greater than zero and shelter-cost-to-income ratios less than 100%
  are assessed for ‘core housing need.’ Non-family households with at least one maintainer
  aged 15 to 29 attending school are considered not to be in ‘core housing need’ regardless
  of their housing circumstances. Attending school is considered a transitional phase,
  and low incomes earned by student households are viewed as being a temporary condition.'
