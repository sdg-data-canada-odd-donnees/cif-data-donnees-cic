# Indicator definition and additional information

national_indicator_description: This indicator tracks the percentage of wastewater
  systems on reserves that meet the effluent quality standards of the [Wastewater
  Systems Effluent 
  Regulations](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2012-139/fulltext.html)
  or an equivalency agreement.

computation_calculations: Not applicable

comments_limitations: This indicator only considers wastewater systems that actively report effluent quality. Currently, a significant number of wastewater systems in indigenous communities do not actively report this data. The data should be interpreted with this limitation in mind.
