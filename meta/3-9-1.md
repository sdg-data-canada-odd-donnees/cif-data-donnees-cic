national_indicator_available: Vaccination rates for selected diseases
target_name: By 2025, 95% coverage of all childhood vaccines and 90% coverage of all
  adolescent vaccines

national_indicator_description: This indicator measures the childhood vaccination
  rates for selected diseases. The Public Health Agency of Canada routinely monitors
  childhood vaccination coverage in Canada through the childhood National Immunization
  Coverage Survey.

national_geographical_coverage: Canada, provinces and territories

data_keywords: women, gender

computation_calculations: |-
  The progress status for this indicator is based on [Canada's national vaccination coverage goals for 2025](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/immunization-vaccine-priorities/national-immunization-strategy/vaccination-coverage-goals-vaccine-preventable-diseases-reduction-targets-2025.html#1.0).

  The estimates for diphtheria coverage are used to measure progress in the percentage of children having received the recommended doses of the diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) vaccine.
  <br><br>
  The estimates for mumps coverage are used to measure progress in the percentage of children having received the recommended doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Measles is not used because foreign-born children in Canada may have received the monovalent measles vaccine in another country and coverage would by consequence be higher.
  <br><br>
  The progress assessment of the varicella vaccine coverage by 2 years of age uses a base year of 2017 due to methodological differences between 2015 and 2017.
  <br><br>
  The estimates for hepatitis B coverage reported by 14 years of age are used to measure progress in the percentage of adolescents having received the recommended dose(s) of hepatitis B vaccine. Data for hepatitis B coverage by 14 years of age is available from 2017 onwards. Previously, hepatitis B coverage among adolescents was measured by 17 years of age.

comments_limitations: |-
  The childhood vaccines included were those that are publicly funded under provincial/territorial programs. Vaccines recommended only for travel and some high-risk groups were excluded. The survey excluded First Nations on-reserve communities and institutionalized children.
  <br><br>
  All vaccine programs in Canada administer a standalone varicella vaccine or a combination vaccine (MMR-V which includes the measles, mumps, rubella and varicella antigen). In 2013 and 2015, MMR-V was not included in the calculation of varicella coverage, thereby under counting the number of varicella doses received.
