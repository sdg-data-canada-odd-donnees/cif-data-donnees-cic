# Indicator definition and additional information

national_indicator_description: This indicator summarizes the risk of extinction for
  individual species in Canada. A species is defined as a population of organisms
  that does not usually interbreed with other populations, even where they overlap
  in space and time. <em>Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC)</em>

computation_calculations: <p>The indicator uses data from Wild Species 2015. Every
  5 years, a Wild Species report by the Canadian Endangered Species Conservation Council
  provides information on a large number of Canadian wild species to assess the general
  status of species and species groups. <br><br>National extinction risk levels are
  an assessment of the likelihood that a species will disappear from Canada (become
  extirpated). Risk levels are based on the rarity of the species, recent trends in
  population size and distribution, and the threats that are present. <em>(ECCC)</em></p>

comments_limitations: <p>The number of species assessed in the Wild Species report
  series has increased from 1 670 in 2000 to 29 848 in 2015. However, there are still
  many species left to assess; the vast majority of them are insects and other invertebrates.
  <br><br>Conservation ranks consider only the risk of extirpation from Canada. In
  some cases, large changes in population size or distribution may not trigger a change
  in rank. <em>(ECCC)</em></p>
