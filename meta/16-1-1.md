# Indicator definition and additional information

national_indicator_description: This indicator measures the proportion of people in
  Canada who reported feeling safe walking alone in their neighborhood after dark.

computation_calculations: Percentages are calculated including non-response categories ("Refusal", "Don't know", and "Not stated") in the denominator.

comments_limitations: Excludes data from the territories for reference year 2021. Men+ includes men as well as some non-binary persons. Women+ includes women as well as some non-binary persons. The 2021 Canadian Housing Survey (CHS) asked one person ('the reference person') to complete the questionnaire in each sampled household. The reference person is the household member that is responsible for housing decisions. Therefore, the results presented in this table represent the perspective of the reference person and not all household members' perceptions.
