# Indicator definition and additional information

national_indicator_description: <p>These indicators provide a measure of the ability
  of river water across Canada to support plants and animals. At each monitoring site,
  specific water quality data are compared to water quality guidelines to create a
  rating for the site. If measured water quality remains within the guidelines, it
  can maintain a healthy ecosystem.<br><br> Water quality at a monitoring site is
  considered excellent when parameters in a river almost always meet their guidelines.
  Conversely, water quality is rated poor when parameters usually do not meet their
  guidelines, sometimes by a wide margin. (<em>Environment and Climate Change Canada
  (ECCC)</em>)</p>

computation_calculations: Water quality is reported in these indicators by measuring
  a number of chemical and physical properties (parameters) in water. The results
  for each parameter are compared to its water quality guideline. <em>(ECCC)</em>

comments_limitations: <p>These indicators reflect the state of water quality in rivers
  in southern Canada. Northern Canada is under-represented.<br><br> The indicators
  only use data for a subset of variables where guidelines exist. They do not cover
  all potential water quality issues in Canada.<br><br> The indicators are based on
  the impacts of a number of parameters at each site. These concentrations do not
  show the effect of spills or other transient events unless samples were collected
  right after the spill happened or their effect on water quality is long-lasting.
