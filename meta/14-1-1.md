# Additional information

national_indicator_description: This indicator measures the proportion of Canada's
  marine area that is conserved. Conserved areas are lands and waters where human
  use is limited. They include protected areas as well as other effective area-based
  conservation measures. <em>Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC)</em>

computation_calculations: The area conserved is estimated by means of a geographical
  analysis based on reported boundaries, accounting for overlaps. <em>(ECCC)</em>

comments_limitations: <p>Land and/or water access and use within protected areas are
  controlled primarily for the purpose of conserving nature (for example, a park,
  a conservation area or a wildlife reserve). Other effective area-based conservation
  measures are also managed over the long term in ways that result in the effective
  conservation of biodiversity. However, they might have been established for other
  purposes. <br><br>Trends are estimated based on the date a site was established,
  rather than the date when it was recognized as a Protected Area or other effective
  area-based conservation measure (OECM). As such, the totals for a previous year
  may change as data are updated. <br><br>Comparisons with previous reports should
  be made with caution, as data quality and completeness continue to improve. Privately
  protected land and other effective area-based conservation measures contribute to
  achievement of Canada's targets, but many are not yet captured within the database.
