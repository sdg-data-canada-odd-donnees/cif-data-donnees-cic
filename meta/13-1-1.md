# Indicator definition and additional information

national_indicator_description: This indicator measures greenhouse gas emissions.
  Greenhouse gases (GHGs) are the atmospheric gases responsible for causing global
  warming and climate change. The major GHGs are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4)
  and nitrous oxide (N20). <em>(definition from United Nations Climate Change)</em>

computation_calculations: <p>In general, GHG emissions are estimated by multiplying
  activity data by the associated emission factor.<br> Emissions = activity data ×
  emission factor<br><br> Activity data refer to the quantitative amount of human
  activity resulting in emissions during a given time period. The annual activity
  data for fuel combustion sources, for example, are the total amounts of fuel burned
  over a year.<br><br> Emission factors are based on samples of measurement data,
  and are representative rates of emissions for a given activity level under a given
  set of operating conditions. It is the estimated average emission rate of a given
  pollutant for a given source, relative to units of activity.<br><br> Guidelines
  produced by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for countries reporting
  to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change provide various methods
  for calculating GHG emissions from a given human activity. The methods for estimating
  emissions are divided into 'tiers,' each encompassing different levels of activity
  and technological detail. The same general structure is used for all tiers, while
  the level of detail at which the calculations are carried out can vary.<br><br>
  Greenhouse gas emissions are reported in carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2 eq), determined
  by multiplying the amount of emissions of a particular greenhouse gas by the global
  warming potential of that gas. <em>Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC)</em></p>

comments_limitations: The Greenhouse gas emissions indicators are comprehensive but
  some emission sources have not been included in the indicators because they are
  not reported in the National Inventory Report. Owing to their relatively small contributions
  to the total emissions, these excluded sources do not significantly affect the overall
  completeness of the inventory. A detailed explanation of the excluded emission sources
  can be found in Annex 5 of the National Inventory Report. Although reported in the
  National Inventory Report, emissions and removals from the land use, land use change
  and forestry sector are excluded from national totals and subsequently not reported
  as part of the Greenhouse gas emissions indicators. <em>(ECCC)</em>
