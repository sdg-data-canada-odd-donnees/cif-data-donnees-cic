target_name: No specific target

national_indicator_description: This indicator measures the age-specific mortality
  rate for selected diseases. The age-specific mortality rate represents the number
  of deaths in a particular age group during a given year per 100,000 population in
  the same age group of the same year.

national_geographical_coverage: Canada

data_keywords: women, gender

computation_calculations: The cause of death tabulated is the underlying cause of
  death. This is defined as (a) the disease or injury which initiated the train of
  events leading directly to death, or (b) the circumstances of the accident or violence
  which produced the fatal injury. The underlying cause is selected from the conditions
  listed on the medical certificate of cause of death.
