# Indicator definition and additional information

national_indicator_description: This indicator tracks the number of publicly available
  electric vehicle charging and alternative fuelling stations in Canada.

computation_calculations: The data in the Alternative Fuelling Station Locator from
  NRCan are gathered and verified through a variety of methods. National Resources
  Canada obtains information about new stations from trade media, the Submit New Station
  form on the Station Locator website, and through collaborating with infrastructure
  equipment and fuel providers, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), and industry
  groups.

comments_limitations: This indicator presents a cumulative sum of all currently available
  electric charging and alternative fuel stations throughout the years up to the latest
  Tuesday. As such, the latest reference year shown does not represent the data for
  the full calendar year but only accounts for the stations opened up to the last
  Tuesday. Please note that data are subject to change as stations that are no longer
  operational or that no longer provide alternative fuels are removed from the database
  as they are identified. As a result, the cumulative counts by year may fluctuate
  over time based on the addition of new stations and the removal of non-operational
  or non-alternative fuel stations.
