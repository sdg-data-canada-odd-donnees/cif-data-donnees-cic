# Indicator definition and additional information

national_indicator_description: This indicator tracks the number of alternative fuel
  stations (Electric, Hydrogen and Liquified Natural Gas) in Canada. “Under development”
  means chargers/ stations for which an agreement is in place, but which have not
  yet been opened to the public. “Completed” means chargers/ stations that are built
  and open to the public for charging or refuelling.

computation_calculations: The data in the Alternative Fuelling Station Locator from
  NRCan are gathered and verified through a variety of methods. National Resources
  Canada obtains information about new stations from trade media, the Submit New Station
  form on the Station Locator website, and through collaborating with infrastructure
  equipment and fuel providers, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), and industry
  groups.
