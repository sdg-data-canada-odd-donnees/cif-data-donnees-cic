# Indicator definition and additional information

national_indicator_description: This indicator tracks the number of publicly available electric vehicle charging and alternative fuelling stations in Canada.  “Completed” means chargers/ stations that are built and open to the public for charging or refuelling.

computation_calculations: The data in the Alternative Fuelling Station Locator from
  NRCan are gathered and verified through a variety of methods. National Resources
  Canada obtains information about new stations from trade media, the Submit New Station
  form on the Station Locator website, and through collaborating with infrastructure
  equipment and fuel providers, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), and industry
  groups.
