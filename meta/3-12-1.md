national_indicator_available: Tuberculosis incidence per 100,000 population in Inuit
  Nunangat
target_name: Eliminate tuberculosis across Inuit Nunangat by 2030, and reducing the
  incidence of active tuberculosis by at least 50% by 2025

national_indicator_description: This indicator measures the Tuberculosis incidence
  rate per 100,000 population in Inuit Nunangat.

national_geographical_coverage: Inuit Nunangat

data_keywords: Indigenous

computation_calculations: The Canadian Tuberculosis Reporting System is a case-based
  surveillance system that maintains non-nominal data on people diagnosed with active
  TB disease in Canada. Data are collected annually from the provinces and territories,
  analyzed by the Public Health Agency of Canada and validated by each province and
  territory.<br><br>British Columbia has not reported on Indigenous status since 2016,
  and therefore did not contribute into these data.

comments_limitations: Please note that due to existing data limitations, the indicator measures the tuberculosis incidence rate among Inuit across Canada rather than Inuit located in Inuit Nunangat. As data measuring tuberculosis incidence per 100,000 population in Inuit Nunangat become available, the indicator will be updated.
