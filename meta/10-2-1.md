# Indicator definition and additional information

national_indicator_description: This indicator measures the proportion of the population
  reporting discrimination or unfair treatment. Hate crimes refer to criminal offences
  motivated by bias, prejudice, or hate based on race, national or ethnic origin,
  language, colour, religion, sex, age, mental or physical disability, sexual orientation
  or any other similar factor, such as profession or political beliefs.

computation_calculations: The estimates represent the proportion of the population
  reporting discrimination or unfair treatment per 100,000 population.

comments_limitations: Over the past two decades, police services across Canada have
  continued to advance their identification and reporting of hate crime incidents.
  Changes in reporting practices can have an effect on hate crime statistics. For
  example, an increase in the number of hate crime incidents reported can be influenced
  by the introduction of a hate crime awareness campaign. Data for Canada include
  provinces and territories.
