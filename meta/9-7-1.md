# Indicator definition  and additional information

national_indicator_description: 'This indicator measures the remaining useful service
  life ratio of infrastructure assets. This ratio indicates the percentage of the
  infrastructure asset class that remains and can enable analysis of where investment
  is most required. The higher the ratio, the more useful life remains. <br><br> The
  remaining useful service life ratio of infrastructure assets is obtained as follows:
  the remaining useful life, which is the difference between the average age of the
  investment spending and their expected service life, is divided by the expected
  service life. For example, if the average age of investment in highways is 6 years
  and the expected service life is 30 years, the ratio is (30 − 6) ÷ 30 = 80%.'
