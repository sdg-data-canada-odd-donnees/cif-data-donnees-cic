# Indicator definition and additional information

national_indicator_description: This indicator measures the proportion of discarded plastic leaked permanently into
  the environment. Of total discarded plastic, a small fraction is leaked permanently
  to the environment - based on data from consulting reports - while the majority
  is collected by waste and recycling management systems.

computation_calculations: Proportion of discarded plastic leaked permanently into
  the environment = (Plastic leaked permanently into the environment / Total disposed
  plastic waste and scrap) * 100

comments_limitations: The main data sources for collected, diverted, and baled plastic
  are Statistics Canada's Waste Management Survey (WMS), CIMT, annual reports from
  industry associations, producer responsibility programs, and provincial waste and
  recycling programs. The total plastic in disposed waste is the sum of directly disposed
  plastic, primary processor residuals, and final processor residuals, which is derived
  by combining WMS data with the underlying data from Environment and Climate Change
  Canada's National Waste Characterization Study.
