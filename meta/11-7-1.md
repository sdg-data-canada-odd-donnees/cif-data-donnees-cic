# Indicator definition and additional information

national_indicator_description:
  This indicator measures the proportion of the population
  aged 12 and over who reported their sense of belonging to their local community
  as being very strong or somewhat strong.

  Number of people aged 12 and over who reported their sense

comments_limitations:
  <p>All estimates are calculated excluding non-response categories
  ('refusal', 'don't know', and 'not stated') in the denominator. <br><br>As a result
  of the 2015 redesign, the Canadian Community Health Survey has a new collection
  strategy, a new sample design, and has undergone major content revisions. With all
  these factors taken together, caution should be taken when comparing data from previous
  cycles to data released for the 2015 cycle onwards.</p>
