# Indicator definition and additional information

national_indicator_description: "This indicator measures the proportion of the population aged 12 and over who reported their sense of belonging to their local community as being very strong or somewhat strong."

computation_calculations: "Number of people who reported their sense of belonging to their local community as being very strong or somewhat strong divided by total population."

rationale_interpretation: "Research shows a high correlation of sense of community-belonging with physical and mental health."

comments_limitations: "<p>All estimates are calculated excluding non-response categories ('refusal', 'don't know', and 'not stated') in the denominator.<br> As a result of the 2015 redesign, the Canadian Community Health Survey has a new collection strategy, a new sample design, and has undergone major content revisions. With all these factors taken together, caution should be taken when comparing data from previous cycles to data released for the 2015 cycle onwards.</p>"
