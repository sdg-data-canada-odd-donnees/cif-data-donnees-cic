# Indicator definition and additional information

national_indicator_description: >-
  This indicator measures the proportion of municipal organizations who factored climate change adapatation into their decision making process, for selected core infrastructure assets.
  <br><br>
  Climate change adaptation is defined as changes in processes, practices, and structures to moderate potential damages or to benefit from opportunities associated with climate change. In 2016, climate change adaptation was defined as anticipating or monitoring climate change and undertaking actions to address the consequences of climate change.
  <br><br>
  Climate change is a long-term shift in weather conditions identified by changes in temperature, precipitation, winds, and other indicators. Climate change can involve both changes in average conditions and changes in variability, including for example, extreme events.

computation_calculations: Number of municipal organization who factored climate change
  in their decision making divided by total number of municipal organization owning
  the infrastructure asset.

comments_limitations: >-
  Estimates for 2018 may not be comparable to those for 2016 due to improved coverage and definitions as well as changes in survey methodology. Estimates for 2022 may not be comparable to those for 2020 due to improved coverage and definitions as well as changes in survey methodology.
  <br><br>
  Some core public infrastructure assets may not be available for all reference periods. Data for shelters and homeless services assets and active transportation assets are only available starting in 2020.
