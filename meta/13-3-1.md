# Indicator definition and additional information

national_indicator_description: <p>This indicator measures the proportion of municipal
  organization who factored climate change adapatation into their decision making
  process, for selected core infrastructure assets.<br> As of 2018, climate change
  adaptation is defined as changes in processes, practices, and structures to moderate
  potential damages or to benefit from opportunities associated with climate change.
  In 2016, climate change adaptation was defined as anticipating or monitoring climate
  change and undertaking actions to address the consequences of climate change.<br><br>
  Climate change is a long-term shift in weather conditions identified by changes
  in temperature, precipitation, winds, and other indicators. Climate change can involve
  both changes in average conditions and changes in variability, including for example,
  extreme events.</p>

computation_calculations: Number of municipal organization who factored climate change
  in their decision making divided by total number of municipal organization owning
  the infrastructure asset.

comments_limitations: Estimates for 2018 may not be comparable to those for 2016 due
  to improved coverage and definitions as well as changes in survey methodology.
