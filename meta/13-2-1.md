# Indicator definition and additional information

national_indicator_description: This indicator measures the number of deaths due to
  excessive natural heat. Canadians may face elevated mortality risks due to climate
  change and more frequent, more intense, and longer extreme heat events.

computation_calculations: Not applicable

comments_limitations: Due to improvements in methodology and timeliness, the duration
  of data collection has been shortened compared to previous years. As a result, there
  may have been fewer deaths captured by the time of release. The 2019 to 2022 data
  are therefore considered preliminary. Death data for Yukon are not available starting
  with the 2017 reference year onwards.
