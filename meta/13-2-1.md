# Indicator definition and additional information

national_indicator_description: This indicator measures the frequency of selected
  natural disasters as defined by the Canadian Disaster Database.

computation_calculations: <p>The Canadian Disaster Database tracks significant disaster
  events that conform to the Emergency Management Framework for Canada's definition
  of a disaster and meet one or more of the following criteria:<br> *  10 or more
  people killed<br> *  100 or more people affected/injured/infected/evacuated or homeless<br>
  *  an appeal for national/international assistance<br> *  historical significance<br>
  *  significant damage/interruption of normal processes such that the community affected
  cannot recover on its own. <em>(Public Safety Canada)</em></p>

comments_limitations: <p>It is important to note that the Canadian Disaster Database
  may not be suitable for comparative analysis because of differences in jurisdictional
  responsibilities, the type of data that is available, and how it is collected and
  used over time.<br><br> The information contained in the Canadian Disaster Database
  is based on information that is sourced from outside parties and may not be accurate
  and should therefore be interpreted with caution. <em>(Public Safety Canada)</em></p>
