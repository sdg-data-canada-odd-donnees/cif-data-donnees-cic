# Indicator definition and additional information

national_indicator_description: This indicator measures the median number of days
  elapsed from first appearance to final decision of criminal court cases.

computation_calculations: A case is one or more charges against an accused person
  or company, which were processed by the courts at the same time (date of offence,
  date of initiation, date of first appearance, or date of decision), and received
  a final decision. The definition attempts to reflect court processing. All data
  have been processed using this case definition. Elapsed times are calculated based
  on the number of days it takes to complete a case, from first appearance to final
  decision. The median is the point at which half of all cases had longer case lengths
  and half had shorter case lengths.

comments_limitations: Excludes cases in which the case length was unknown. Sex is
  determined on the basis of the accused's name in Quebec, producing a relatively
  higher rate of sex unknown. Information on the sex of the accused is not available
  from Manitoba.
