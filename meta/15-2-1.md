# Indicator definition and additioanl information

national_indicator_description: The indicator shows whether population and distribution
  trends of species at risk are consistent with the objectives in final recovery strategies
  or management plans. <em>Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC)</em>

computation_calculations: 'Population and distribution trend information for each
  species is compared to its objectives to determine whether it is on track to meet
  those objectives. Each species is assigned to 1 of 4 categories based on whether
  it is making progress toward objectives: yes, no, mixed evidence, or insufficient
  information. The indicator is a count of the number of species in the yes, no or
  mixed evidence categories. <em>(ECCC)</em>'

comments_limitations: <p>All species for which final recovery strategies or management
  plans exist are considered, namely species listed as extirpated, endangered, threatened,
  or special concern. A species is included in the indicator if it meets the following
  criteria. <br>1. Species listed as extirpated, endangered or threatened must be
  deemed feasible to recover <br>2. The species' recovery strategy or management plan
  has objectives relating to population size, distribution or both <br>3. Species
  have been reassessed since the publication of the final recovery strategy or management
  plan, to allow for population and distribution trends to be compared to the objectives
  <br>4. Sufficient information must be available to assess if the species' population
  and distribution trends are consistent with the recovery or management objectives
  <br><br>Results should not be interpreted as a measure of recovery or management
  success until sufficient time has passed to allow species to respond and to allow
  enough information to be collected to assess the recovery or management. <em>(ECCC)</em></p>
