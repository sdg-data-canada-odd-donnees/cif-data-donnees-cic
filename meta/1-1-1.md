national_indicator_available: Poverty rate, as measured by Canada’s official poverty
  line
target_name: By 2030, a 50% reduction in the rate of poverty, compared to the 2015
  level

national_indicator_description: This indicator measures the percentage of persons
  in low income using the Market Basket Measures (MBM), which was adopted as Canada's
  Official Poverty Line. According to the MBM, a family lives in poverty if it does
  not have enough income to purchase a specific basket of goods and services in its
  community.

national_geographical_coverage: Canada, Geographical region of Canada, Province or territory, Census metropolitan area

data_keywords: women, gender

computation_calculations: The Market Basket Measure (MBM) is based on the cost of
  a specific basket of goods and services representing a modest, basic standard of
  living. It includes the costs of food, clothing, shelter, transportation and other
  items for a reference family. These costs are compared to the disposable income
  of families to determine whether or not they fall below the poverty line.

comments_limitations: It covers all individuals in Canada, excluding persons living
  on reserves and other Aboriginal settlements in the provinces, the institutionalized
  population, and households in extremely remote areas with very low population density.
  Overall, these exclusions amount to less than 2 percent of the population.
