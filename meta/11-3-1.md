# Indicator definition and additional information

national_indicator_description: This indicator tracks the percentage of the population
  across Canada living in areas where concentrations of outdoor air pollutants were
  less than or equal to the 2020 Canadian Ambient Air Quality Standards (CAAQS, the
  standards). The CAAQS are health- and environmental-based outdoor air quality objectives
  for pollutant concentrations in the air. The standards are intended to further protect
  human health and the environment and to promote continuous improvement in air quality
  across Canada. <em>Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC)</em>

computation_calculations: The indicator is calculated by comparing the spatially averaged
  pollutant concentration for each geographical area with the respective 2020 Canadian
  Ambient Air Quality Standards (CAAQS, the standards). The total population of all
  geographical areas where the average concentrations for all pollutants are less
  than or equal to the respective standards are compared to the national population.
  <em>(ECCC)</em>

comments_limitations: From 2005 to 2021, approximately 63.5% of the population lived
  in areas covered by selected air quality monitoring stations that meet the data
  completeness criteria. The indicator assumes that the remainder of the population
  lives in areas where outdoor concentrations of ozone, fine particulate matter, sulphur
  dioxide and nitrogen dioxide are less than or equal to their 2020 standards. Populations
  in northern regions of the country have less coverage, as monitoring stations tend
  to be situated near urban areas with a higher population density. Due to unpredictable
  variability in extreme weather events such as wildfires, results may fluctuate significantly
  from one reporting period to another. <em>(ECCC)</em>
