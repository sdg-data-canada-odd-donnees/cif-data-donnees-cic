# Indicator definition and additional information

national_indicator_description: This indicator measures the proportion of the population
  within the geographic unit living within 500 meters of a public transit stop.

computation_calculations: <p>The main method used to estimate the percentage of Canadians
  living within 500 meters of a public transport access point is as follows:<br><br>  a)
  The location of public transport stops of all kinds (bus, trolley, surface and underground
  rail) were accessed from city web-sites or acquired from local transit authorities.
  Almost complete coverage was obtained for the municipalities making up the 35 metropolitan
  cities.<br><br>  b) The public transit stop locations were incorporated within Statistics
  Canadaâ€™s geographic databases containing population counts for 2016 Census Dissemination
  Blocks. All Dissemination Blocks located within a 500 meter radius of a transit
  stop were selected, and summed for the municipality. A straight-line distance is
  sometimes not the most direct route, but it is consistently applied to facilitate
  comparison across cities. This approach will produce a slight over-estimate.<br><br>  c)
  In the final step, the population living within 500 meters is divided by the total
  population of the entire metropolitan city.<br> The total population is used, as
  it provided a better indication of the true count of persons interacting socially
  and economically within the space of the metropolitan area, and thus potentially
  using public transportation.</p>
