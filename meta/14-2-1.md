# Indicator definition and additional information

national_indicator_description: This indicator reports on the status (Healthy, Cautious,
  Critical or Uncertain) of key Canadian fish stocks. Human use of the oceans (including
  fishing) and environmental conditions affect the abundance and health of fish stocks
  at national and global levels. In order to maintain fish stocks for future generations,
  it is important to track their status and adjust management measures (such as harvest
  rates and limits). <em>Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC)</em>

computation_calculations: Federal scientists use a variety of scientific methods to
  assess fish stock levels and assign them a stock status zone (Healthy, Cautious
  or Critical) by comparing the size of the stocks to reference points. If there is
  insufficient information to determine the stock status zone, the status is uncertain.
  <em>(ECCC)</em>

comments_limitations: The indicator includes key stocks of fish, invertebrates, and
  marine mammals. Seaweeds and other aquatic plants are excluded. Stock status assessments
  are not conducted annually for every stock, therefore, recent changes in stock status
  may not be captured. Changes in the set of surveyed stocks occur due to changes
  in the way stocks are assessed or managed. Results should be interpreted with this
  in mind. <em>(ECCC)</em>
