# Indicator definition and additional information

national_indicator_description: The indicator compares harvest rates with established
  harvest limits. These limits are based on scientific information, providing a direct
  measure of whether we are managing the use of these resources within ecosystem limits.
  It is one measure of fishing pressure on wild fish stocks. <em>Environment and Climate
  Change Canada (ECCC)</em>

computation_calculations: The indicator compares harvest rates with harvest limits.
  These limits are based on scientific information and provide a direct measure of
  whether we are managing the use of these resources within ecosystem limits. The
  indicator is a simple tabulation of stocks based on whether harvest levels are within
  removal reference levels, within other harvest limits, or over harvest limits. <em>(ECCC)</em>

comments_limitations: <p>Overharvest in a single year does not mean that a stock is
  harvested unsustainably. Rather, it leads to a management response. Stocks managed
  through quotas, for example, are subject to quota reconciliation, meaning that any
  overharvest of a stock in one year is deducted from the harvest limit established
  for the following year. <br><br>The Sustainability Survey for Fisheries is completed
  with the best available information. Since the oceans are wide and deep, and fish
  move between habitats, their populations are difficult to monitor. <br><br>The survey
  summarizes information across a wide variety of species, management regimes, types
  of fisheries, geographic regions, and socio-economic contexts. Small changes in
  the set of surveyed stocks occur due to changes in the way stocks are assessed or
  managed. Results should be interpreted with this in mind. <br><br>The indicator
  does not account for fished stocks that do not meet the criteria for major stocks.
  Seaweeds and other aquatic plants are also excluded. <em>(ECCC)</em></p>
