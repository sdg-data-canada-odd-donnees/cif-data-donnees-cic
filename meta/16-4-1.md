# Indicator definition and additional information

national_indicator_description: This indicator measures the number of days elapsed from the initiation of a civil court case to its first disposition.

computation_calculations: A disposition is a court event that disposes part or all of the civil case (settlement, consent judgment and judgment). A general civil case is any civil action that is not a family-related action, such as contracts, torts, bankruptcy, probate matters, and other claims involving money. Family cases are cases involving family law-related issues, including child protection, divorce, separation, custody and access, division of property, support, and adoption.
