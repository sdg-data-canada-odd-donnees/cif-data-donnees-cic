# Indicator definition and additional information

national_indicator_description: "This indicator measures the number of cyber-related violations."

computation_calculations: "A criminal incident may be comprised of multiple violations of the law. For the analysis of cyber-related violations, one distinct violation within the incident was identified as the 'cybercrime violation'. The cybercrime violation represents the specific criminal violation within an incident in which a computer or the internet was the target of the crime, or the instrument used to commit the crime. For the majority of incidents, the cybercrime violation and the most serious violation were the same."

comments_limitations: "Includes data from municipal and provincial police services as well as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) covering 99.7% of the Canadian population. Calgary Police Service cybercrime data for 2017, 2018 and 2019 are suspected cybercrimes only and should be interpreted with caution."
