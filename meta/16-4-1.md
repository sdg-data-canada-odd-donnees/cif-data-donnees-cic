# Indicator definition and additional information

national_indicator_description: This indicator measures the time elapsed from the initiation of a civil court case to its first disposition. <br><br>
A disposition is a court event that disposes part or all of the civil case (settlement, consent judgment and judgment). A general civil case is any civil action that is not a family-related action, such as contracts, torts, bankruptcy, probate matters, and other claims involving money. Family cases are cases involving family law-related issues, including child protection, divorce, separation, custody and access, division of property, support, and adoption.

computation_calculations: Not applicable

comments_limitations: The Civil Court Survey (CCS) collects data on civil court events and cases at both the superior and provincial-territorial court levels. Appeal courts, federal courts (for example, Tax Court of Canada) and the Supreme Court of Canada are out of scope for this survey. Data are based on the fiscal year (April 1st to March 31st).
