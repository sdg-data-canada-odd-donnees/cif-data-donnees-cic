# Indicator definition and additional information

national_indicator_description: This indicator measures the proportion of forested
  areas as a proportion of total land area. Forest area is a basic sustainability
  indicator and is important to monitor closely, particularly in regions where forest
  area is being lost. <em>(NRCan)</em>

computation_calculations: Forested areas data presented are based on Canada’s National
  Forest Inventory (2005 base year), and adjusted annually for estimated forest area
  lost (deforestation) and gained (afforestation). <em>(NRCan)</em> Starting in 2018,
  the data are estimates using a previous year’s deforestation rate, therefore must
  be treated as an imputed value.
