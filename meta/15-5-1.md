# Indicator definition and additional information

national_indicator_description: This indicator measures the total amount of timber harvested annually as a percentage of the sustainable wood supply. To ensure that forests can continue to provide timber, harvests must remain within sustainable limits. The sustainable wood supply is defined as the potential volume of timber which can be harvested sustainably as determined by a complex analysis of ecological, economic, and social considerations. <em>Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC)</em>
