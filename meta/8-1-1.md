# Indicator definition and additional information

national_indicator_description: This indicator measures the unemployment rate. The
  unemployment rate is the number of unemployed persons expressed as a percentage
  of the labour force.

computation_calculations: The unemployment rate for a particular group (age, sex,
  marital status, etc.) is the number unemployed in that group expressed as a percentage
  of the labour force for that group. Estimates are percentages, rounded to the nearest
  tenth.

comments_limitations: |-
  Excluded from the coverage are: persons living on reserves and other Aboriginal settlements in the provinces; full-time members of the Canadian Armed Forces, the institutionalized population, and households in extremely remote areas with very low population density.
  <br><br>
  The Labour Force Survey (LFS) started collecting gender of person in 2022. Prior to 2022, LFS only collected information on sex of person (male or female), as declared by the respondent or recorded by the interviewer. The sex variable prior to 2022 and the two-category gender variable since 2022 are combined in this table. Although sex and gender refer to two different concepts, the introduction of gender is not expected to have a significant impact on data analysis and historical comparability, given the small size of the transgender and non-binary populations.
  <br><br>
  Given that the non-binary population is small, data aggregation to a two-category gender variable is necessary to protect the confidentiality of responses provided. Individuals in the category “non-binary persons” are distributed into the other two gender categories and are denoted by the “+” symbol. The category “Men+” includes men, as well as some non-binary persons, while the category “Women+” includes women, as well as some non-binary persons.
