national_indicator_description:
  This indicator measures the percentage of Canadians
  aged 18 and over who reported perceiving their own health status as being either
  excellent or very good or fair or poor. Perceived health refers to the perception
  of a person's health in general, either by the person himself or herself, or, in
  the case of proxy response, by the person responding. Health means not only the
  absence of disease or injury but also physical, mental and social well-being.

  The indicator covers the population 18 years of age and over living in the ten provinces and the three territories. Excluded from the survey's coverage are: persons living on reserves and other Aboriginal settlements in the provinces; full-time members of the Canadian Forces; the institutionalized population, and persons living in the Quebec health regions of Région du Nunavik and Région des Terres-Cries-de-la-Baie-James. Altogether, these exclusions represent less than 3% of the Canadian population aged 18 and over.
