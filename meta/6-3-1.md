national_indicator_available: Water use growth rate
target_name: No specific target

national_indicator_description: This indicator measures the growth rate in water use
  for different sectors of the economy as well as for households. Water use refers
  to the intake of water either self-supplied (i.e. direct abstraction from the environment)
  or supplied from municipal systems.

national_geographical_coverage: Canada

computation_calculations: Water use growth rate = ((Water use in a given year - Water
  use in the year prior) / Water use in the year prior) x 100 <br><br> Water use per
  capita = Water use of households / Population <br><br> Water use per capita growth
  rate = ((Water use per capita in a given year - Water use per capita in the year
  prior) / Water use per capita in the year prior) x 100

comments_limitations: The data does not include an estimate for the volume of water
  that passes through hydro-electric turbines, nor of the water that flows through
  agricultural crops and cultivated forests as a result of the uptake of soil water
  by plants.
