# Indicator definition and additional information

national_indicator_description: This indicator measures the proportion of electricity generated from renewable and non-greenhouse gas emitting sources.

computation_calculations: Not applicable

comments_limitations: "For the purpose of this indicator, “renewable and non-greenhouse gas emitting sources” includes energy generated from hydraulic turbines, solar, tidal power turbine, wind power turbine and other types of renewable and non-greenhouse gas emitting sources. This indicator does not include electricity generated from thermal generation such as nuclear steam turbine, biomass and other types of thermal generation. Please see the [Energy Fact Book](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/science-and-data/data-and-analysis/energy-data-and-analysis/energy-facts/clean-power-and-low-carbon-fuels/23932) from Natural Resources Canada to track the proportion of energy generated from non-greenhouse gas emitting sources which includes energy generated from nuclear steam turbine and biomass."
