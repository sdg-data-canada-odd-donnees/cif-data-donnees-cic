# Indicator definition and additional information

national_indicator_description: This indicator measures the proportion of electricity
  generated from renewable and non-greenhouse gas emitting sources, which includes
  energy generated from hydraulic turbines, solar, tidal power turbines, wind power
  turbines, nuclear steam turbines and all electricity produced from biomass.

computation_calculations: <p>Monthly data on electric power generation are annualized
  and the sum of megawatt hours produced by renewable and non-greenhouse gas emitting
  sources are expressed as a proportion of the total electricity generated.</p><p>To
  align concepts between indicators, the methodology to calculate this indicator was
  updated in spring 2023 to include electricity generated from nuclear steam turbine
  and biomass in the definition of “electricity generated from renewable and non-greenhouse
  gas emitting sources.” This change does not affect the targets for the indicator
  but rather ensures comparable definitions and measurement between this indicator
  and the one published in the <a 
  href="https://natural-resources.canada.ca/science-and-data/data-and-analysis/energy-data-and-analysis/energy-facts/clean-power-and-low-carbon-fuels/23932">Energy
  Fact Book</a> by Natural Resources Canada.</p>

comments_limitations: <p>Please note the following reason for the difference in the
  methodology used for this indicator and the one used for the indicator presented
  in the <a 
  href="https://natural-resources.canada.ca/science-and-data/data-and-analysis/energy-data-and-analysis/energy-facts/clean-power-and-low-carbon-fuels/23932">Energy
  Fact Book</a> from Natural Resources Canada. The relatively small difference between
  the two proportions is due to the different methodologies used to estimate the energy
  generated from grid-connected photovoltaic systems.  The energy generated from these
  systems is estimated through model-based calculations by Natural Resources Canada.
  The Statistics Canada estimate is based on data collected through surveys and excludes
  energy generated from photovoltaics systems with capacities below 100 kW and some
  systems with capacities between 100 kW and 1 mW.</p>
