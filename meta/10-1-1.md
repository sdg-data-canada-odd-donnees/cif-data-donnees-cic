# Indicator definition and  additional information

national_indicator_description: This indicator measures the Gini coefficient. The
  Gini coefficient is a number between zero and one that measures the relative degree
  of inequality in the distribution of income.

computation_calculations: The Gini coefficient would register zero (minimum inequality)
  for a population in which each person received exactly the same adjusted household
  income and it would register a coefficient of one (maximum inequality) if one person
  received all the adjusted household income and the rest received none.

comments_limitations: It covers all individuals in Canada, excluding persons living
  on reserves and other Aboriginal settlements in the provinces, the institutionalized
  population, and households in extremely remote areas with very low population density.
  Overall, these exclusions amount to less than 2 percent of the population.
