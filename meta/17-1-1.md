# Indicator definition and additional information

national_indicator_description: '<p> The Statistical Performance Indicators (SPI)
  assess the maturity and performance of national statistical systems in five key
  areas, called pillars. The five pillars are:<br><br> 1. Data Use: Statistics have
  value only if they are used. A successful statistical system produces data that
  are used widely and frequently.<br> 2. Data Services: A range of services connects
  data users to producers and facilitate dialogues between them, thus building trust
  and a sense of value.<br> 3. Data Products: The dialogues between users and producers
  drive the design and range of statistical products and their accuracy, timeliness,
  frequency, comparability, and levels of disaggregation. The products signal whether
  countries are able to produce indicators related to the 17 Sustainable Development
  Goals.<br> 4. Data Sources: To create useful products, the statistical system needs
  to draw on sources inside and outside the government. Data collection thus goes
  beyond the typical censuses and surveys to include administrative and geospatial
  data as well as data generated by private firms and citizens.<br> 5. Data Infrastructure:
  A mature statistical system has well-developed hard infrastructure (legislation,
  governance, standards) and soft infrastructure (skills, partnerships) as well as
  the financial resources to deliver useful—and widely used—data products and services.<br><br>
  Each of these pillars is supported by four or five dimensions and uses defined methods
  and indicators. <em>(World Bank Group)</em><br><br> The series labelled as "Canada"
  represents the overall SPI score for Canada. </p>'

computation_calculations: The scores for each pillar are calculated using the scores
  for the underlying dimensions, which in turn are derived from the values of their
  indicators. The overall SPI score is an average of the scores for the five pillars.
  For the overall score, a country can achieve a maximum of 100 and a minimum of 0.
  A score of 100 would indicate that a country has every single element that the SPI
  measures in place, and a score of 0 that none are in place. <em>(World Bank Group)</em>

comments_limitations: The overall SPI score is currently available for countries from
  2016 onwards. Some indicators have data going back to 2004. <em>(World Bank Group)</em>
