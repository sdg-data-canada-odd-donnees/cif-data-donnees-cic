national_indicator_description: "This indicator measures the proportion of time spent
  on unpaid domestic and care work. Unpaid domestic and care work includes: household
  chores, care of household children or adults and shopping for goods and services."

  based on a seven day week and the proportion of day is based on a 24 hour day.

comments_limitations: <p>Excludes territories and institutionalized population.
<br><br>Given that the non-binary population is small, data aggregation to a two-category gender variable is sometimes necessary to protect the confidentiality of responses provided. In these cases, individuals in the category “non-binary persons” are distributed into the other two gender categories and are denoted by the “+” symbol.
<br><br>The sex variable in the 2015 Time Use Survey and the two-category gender variable in the 2022 Time Use Survey are included together in this indicator. Although sex and gender refer to two different concepts, the introduction of gender is not expected to have a significant impact on data analysis and historical comparability, given the small size of the transgender and non-binary populations. For additional information on changes of concepts over time, please consult the Age, Sex at Birth and Gender Reference Guide.</p>
