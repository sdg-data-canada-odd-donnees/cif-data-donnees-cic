Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada developed a set of science-based agri-environmental indicators (AEIs) that integrate information on soils, climate and topography with statistics on land use and crop and livestock management practices. The indices are divided in five “health classes”, defined as: 80-100 Desired; 60-79 Good; 40-59 Moderate; 20-39 Poor; 0-19 At risk."
