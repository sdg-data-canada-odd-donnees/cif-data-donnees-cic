national_indicator_description: 'This indicator is an index that measures Agri-Environmental
  Sustainability. Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada developed a set of science-based
  agri-environmental indicators (AEIs) that integrate information on soils, climate
  and topography with statistics on land use and crop and livestock management practices.
  The indices are divided in five “health classes”, defined as: 80-100 Desired; 60-79
  Good; 40-59 Moderate; 20-39 Poor; 0-19 At risk.'
