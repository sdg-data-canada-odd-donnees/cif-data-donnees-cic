# Indicator definition and additional information

national_indicator_description: "This indicator measures the amount of waste diverted per capita."

computation_calculations: "Non-residential sources include solid non-hazardous recyclable material from the Industrial, Commercial, and Institutional sector as well as the Construction, Renovation and Demolition sector. Materials are those generated by all IC and I and CRD sources in a municipality, and are excluded from the residential waste stream. Residential non-hazardous recyclable materials include solid non-hazardous materials produced in all residences and include non-hazardous materials that are picked up by the municipality and non-hazardous materials from residential sources that are self-hauled to depots, transfer stations and disposal facilities."

comments_limitations: "This information covers only those companies and local waste management organizations that reported non-hazardous recyclable material preparation activities and refers only to that material entering the waste stream and does not cover any waste that may be managed on-site by a company or household. Additionally, these data do not include those materials transported by the generator directly to secondary processors, such as pulp and paper mills, while bypassing entirely any firm or local government involved in waste management activities. Residential and non-residential splits are not available at the total level, as electronic and tire source data are unavailable."
