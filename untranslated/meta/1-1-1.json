{"national_indicator_available":"Poverty rate, as measured by Canada\u2019s official poverty line","target_name":"50% reduction compared to the poverty rate of 2015, by 2030","national_indicator_description":"This indicator measures the percentage of persons in low income using the Market Basket Measures (MBM), which was adopted as Canada's Official Poverty Line. According to the MBM, a family lives in poverty if it does not have enough income to purchase a specific basket of goods and services in its community.","national_geographical_coverage":"Canada and provinces","computation_calculations":"The Market Basket Measure (MBM) is based on the cost of a specific basket of goods and services representing a modest, basic standard of living. It includes the costs of food, clothing, shelter, transportation and other items for a reference family. These costs are compared to the disposable income of families to determine whether or not they fall below the poverty line.","comments_limitations":"It covers all individuals in Canada, excluding persons living on reserves and other Aboriginal settlements in the provinces, the institutionalized population, and households in extremely remote areas with very low population density. Overall, these exclusions amount to less than 2 percent of the population.","rationale_interpretation":"As stated the Poverty Reduction Act, Every Canadian deserves a real and fair chance to succeed, no matter where they live or where they come from. The Act sets poverty reduction targets and establishes the National Advisory Council on Poverty. Canada\u2019s Official Poverty Line, based on the Market Basket Measure, will measure poverty and track progress toward the targets.","graph_title":"Percentage of persons in low income","graph_type":"line","graph_annotations":[{"unit":"Percentage","value":7.25,"preset":"target_line"}],"computation_units":"Percentage","data_start_values":[{"field":"Geography","value":"Canada"},{"field":"Persons","value":"All persons"}],"indicator_name":"Poverty rate, as measured by Canada\u2019s official poverty line","indicator_sort_order":"01-01-01","published":true,"reporting_status":"complete","indicator_number":"1.1.1","sdg_goal":"1","data_non_statistical":false,"target_id":"1.1","data_show_map":false,"source_active_1":true,"source_url_text_1":"Statistics Canada.
